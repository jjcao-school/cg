# Quiz Question (1 pt)

The TAs will choose one of the following questions during the grading session. Please be prepared to give a one-minute answer with your partner.

1. How does light interact differently with different objects in real life? Give 3 examples. 
2. Why do objects appear to have different colors to our eyes?
3. What's the advantage of using YUV color space?
4. How are colors added differently for lights compared to paint? What does R+G+B equal to in each case?
5. Why are green screens green? Hint: think about the arrangement of color filters in front of the camera sensor.
6. Why is tone mapping needed for HDR images?
7. ~~What's the relationship between the wavelength of the light and the color of the light? E.g. why is the wavelength of 700nm associated with red, and 400nm associated with purple?~~
